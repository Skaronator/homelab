# GitOps Driven Homelab

This project utilizes Infrastructure as Code and GitOps to automate the provisioning, operation, and updating of self-hosted services in my homelab.

## Hardware Stack

After nearly a decade with Debian and ZFS, Iâ€™ve switched to Unraid for a more power-efficient storage solution.
Unlike ZFS, Unraid allows idle disks to spin down, significantly reducing energy consumption while still providing over 100 TB of RAID storage.

My setup consists of a single Unraid server that runs Kubernetes in Talos VMs.

        end
        nfs <--> cp1 & w1
  end
```
